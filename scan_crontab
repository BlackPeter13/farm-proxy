# List of entities to scan
# Each entity must have a unique IP range and name
# In our example, each IP range represents a building.
# At least one row is required when dynamic scan of miners is required 

# <cron schedule expression> ssh_scan.sh "<IP range>" "entity name"
# 1. field = seconds, 2. field = minutes, 3. field = hours, 4. field = day of the month, 5. field = month, 6. field = day of the week, 7. field = year
# see https://www.netiq.com/documentation/cloud-manager-2-5/ncm-reference/data/bexyssf.html to understand cron sytax
# see https://crontab.guru/ on how to specify the cron schedule expression and practice it
